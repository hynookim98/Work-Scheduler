# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginner programmer studying at the UCI coding Bootcamp. This program was created to be able to schedule out your busy work schedule on an easy to use web app. This scheduler contains slots for all 24 hours in the day (formatted in 24-hour format) to make it accessible for people with a full schedule. The current day is displayed on the top and the hour blocks are color coded depending on the hour. The current hour will be displayed as red, the past as gray, and the future as green. 
Here is a screenshot of the functioning web app.
